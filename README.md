# Vibe-Coding: Multi-Agent Prompt Framework

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome!

This repo is part of a bigger idea â€” to create a simple, reusable framework for building real software using **AI agents that collaborate like a team**.

Itâ€™s built around a multi-agent prompting flow, where each AI agent (Product Manager, Architect, Designer, Dev Lead, Executors) plays a specific role, based on clear inputs and outputs.

### ðŸ¤– What is this repo?

This repo is the **starting point** â€” a collection of prompt templates that define how to:
- Kick off a new initiative from scratch
- Move from product vision â†’ architecture â†’ design â†’ development
- Keep everything clear, structured, and simple

Each file here is a prompt for a different role in the flow. These are the core building blocks of the framework.

### ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s next?

This is just the beginning.  
Weâ€™re going to add new folders that define prompt-based methodologies for:
- Adding new features to existing codebases
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Implementing SSDLC and running security scans
- ...and more

All in the same friendly, simple, and structured approach.
