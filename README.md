# Vibe-Coding: Multi-Agent Prompt Framework

Hey there 👋 and welcome!

This repo is part of a bigger idea — to create a simple, reusable framework for building real software using **AI agents that collaborate like a team**.

It's built around a multi-agent prompting flow, where each AI agent (Product Manager, Architect, Designer, Dev Lead, Executors) plays a specific role, based on clear inputs and outputs.

### 🤖 What is this repo?

This repo is the **starting point** — a collection of prompt templates that define how to:
- Kick off a new initiative from scratch
- Move from product vision → architecture → design → development
- Keep everything clear, structured, and simple
- Implement security pipelines for your repositories

Each file here is a prompt for a different role in the flow. These are the core building blocks of the framework.

📌 You can read more about the full methodology in the blog post:

### 🚀 What's next?

This is just the beginning.  
We're going to add new folders that define prompt-based methodologies for:
- Adding new features to existing codebases
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- ...and more

All in the same friendly, simple, and structured approach.

### 🔒 Latest Additions

We've just added **security pipeline guide prompts** that show you how to:
- Add enterprise-grade security scanning to your repositories
- Implement SAST, dependency scanning, and secret detection
- Set up compliance with OWASP Top 10, GDPR, and SOC 2 standards
- Create a phased security implementation approach

Check out the `guiding_prompts/security_pipeline` folder to see how you can secure your own projects using AI-guided implementation.
